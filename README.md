# Ernesto LOPEZ FUNE

I am a French-Cuban Physicist and Data Scientist, currently residing in Paris, France. My academic journey began in 2004 at the University of Havana, where I earned my B.Sc. in Physics while simultaneously completing all coursework for the Mathematics curriculum. During my studies, I also gained teaching experience, leading laboratory classes in Mechanics, Electromagnetism, and Optics for students from various scientific disciplines. After graduating in 2009 (Cuban university programs span five years), I pursued a M.Sc. in Physics with a specialization in Theoretical Physics, which I completed in 2011. Concurrently, I worked as a Junior Researcher at the Institute of Cybernetics, Mathematics, and Physics (ICIMAF) and taught tutorials in Ordinary Differential Equations and Calculus of Variations to physics and engineering students.

In 2012, I moved to Trieste, Italy, on a scholarship for the Diploma Programme in High Energy Physics at the [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/), where I conducted research on Neutrinoless Double β-decay and Physics Beyond the Standard Model. After a highly competitive selection process, I was awarded another scholarship in 2013 to join the Joint Ph.D. Programme at ICTP and [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/) in Astroparticle Physics. My Ph.D. thesis, successfully defended in 2017, combined phenomenology, data analysis, and machine learning, with a focus on dark matter at galactic scales and [empirical velocity profiles](https://github.com/elopezfune/Empirical-Velocity-Profiles).

Post-Ph.D., I relocated to Paris for a postdoctoral role at [LPNHE](https://lpnhe.in2p3.fr/), contributing to the [XENON1T](https://xenonexperiment.org/) experiment. My work involved academic research, data processing, analysis, and the search for rare events that might indicate the presence of dark matter particles in collision with Xenon nuclei, a mission I continued until the end of 2019, publishing articles in [*Physical Review Letters*](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.241803), the [*Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/475/2/2132/4768263?login=false) and [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1124-4).

The Covid-19 pandemic marked a turning point in my career as I transitioned to Data Science, motivated by a passion for predicting behaviors across diverse domains. Since then, I've applied my expertise across sectors such as Cybersecurity, Predictive Medicine, and Risk Management. My multicultural and multilingual background has been pivotal in fostering collaboration and communication, making me a valuable asset in dynamic, diverse environments.
